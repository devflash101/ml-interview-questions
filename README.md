## Lead the effort to leverage existing AI models and frameworks to solve business problems across domains

### Can you describe a situation where you led a team to leverage existing AI models and frameworks to solve a specific business problem?
In my previous role, we faced a challenge in improving customer support efficiency. We decided to leverage existing NLP models to create an AI-driven chatbot. I led the team in evaluating various frameworks such as Googleâ€™s Dialogflow and Microsoft Bot Framework. We selected Dialogflow due to its robust NLP capabilities and ease of integration with our existing infrastructure.

I coordinated with our customer support team to understand the most common issues and queries. We then trained the chatbot using historical support tickets, fine-tuning the model to ensure high accuracy in understanding and responding to user queries. The implementation reduced response times by 40% and allowed our support team to focus on more complex issues, significantly enhancing overall customer satisfaction.
